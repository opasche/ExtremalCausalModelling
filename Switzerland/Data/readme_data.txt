This subfolder should contain the Swiss river discharge dataset (`river_dat.Rdata`) and Swiss precipitation dataset (`precip.csv`). We unfortunately do not have rights to share them directly here, but they are available to academics uppon request, from the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) (https://www.hydrodaten.admin.ch/) and MeteoSwiss (https://gate.meteoswiss.ch/idaweb), respectively. Some additional processed data is then output in the `../data_wrangled/` subfolder by, in particular, `../Stations_webscraping.ipynb` and `../RData_to_csv.R`.
